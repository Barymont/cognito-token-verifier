Contributing
------------
- **Familiarize yourself with the project:** Before contributing to a repository, it's important to understand the project's goals, scope, and existing codebase. Read the project's documentation, study the existing code, and try to get a sense of the project's overall structure.

- **Follow the coding standards:** Most projects have coding standards that contributors are expected to follow. These standards ensure that the code is consistent, easy to read, and maintainable. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the project's coding standards and adhere to them. Consider using Gitmoji, a system of emojis that can be used in Git commit messages to help convey the nature of the changes being made. More info in https://gitmoji.dev/

- **Use descriptive commit messages:** When you make changes to the codebase, make sure to write descriptive commit messages that explain what you changed and why. This will help other contributors understand your changes and make it easier to review your pull requests. Consider using Gitmoji in your commit messages to help convey the nature of the changes being made.

- **Write clear, concise code:** Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive variable names, avoid overly complex code, and comment your code where necessary. This will make it easier for other contributors to review and modify your code.

- **Test your changes:** Make sure to test your changes before submitting them. This will help catch bugs and ensure that your changes work as intended. If the project has an existing test suite, make sure to run it to ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality.

- **Submit small, focused pull requests:** When submitting pull requests, try to keep them small and focused. This will make it easier for other contributors to review your changes and give feedback. If you have multiple changes to make, consider breaking them up into separate pull requests.

- **Be open to feedback:** When submitting pull requests, be open to feedback from other contributors. Listen to their suggestions and make changes where necessary. Remember that the goal is to improve the project as a whole, not to push your own agenda.

- **Be respectful:** Finally, always be respectful and professional when interacting with other contributors. Remember that everyone is working towards the same goal of improving the project, and treat others with the same respect that you would want to be treated with. Consider using Gitmoji in your commit messages to help convey your emotions and make your messages more engaging.
