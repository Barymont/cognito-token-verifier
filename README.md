</div>

## About the Project
Cognito is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to authenticate and access AWS resources through credentials such as ClientID and Secret, or username and password. After a user successfully authenticates, Cognito returns a JSON Web Token (JWT), which contains the main information required to verify that the user has accessed our application. This library verifies that the signature of the JWT comes from a desired application.
